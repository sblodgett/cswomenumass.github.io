I am a first year MS/PhD student working with Brendan O'Connor in natural language processing. I am especially interested in using statistical text analysis to answer social science questions. I graduated with a degree in mathematics from Wellesley College.

At UMass, I am also a member of Graduate Women in STEM and am working to expand mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate women.
